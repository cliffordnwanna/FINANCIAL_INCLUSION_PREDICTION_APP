# **Financial Inclusion Prediction**

## **Overview**
The **Financial Inclusion Prediction** project aims to predict whether individuals in East Africa are likely to have a bank account based on demographic information and various financial service usage patterns. Utilizing a machine learning model, this application helps identify individuals who may benefit from targeted financial services, contributing to increased financial inclusion across the region.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains demographic information for approximately **33,600 individuals** across East Africa, detailing their access to financial services. It includes variables such as age, gender, education level, and relationship with the head of the household.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical features.
- **Machine Learning**: Train a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict financial inclusion based on input features.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** that allows users to input data and receive predictions.

## **Installation**
To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Financial-Inclusion-Prediction.git
   cd Financial-Inclusion-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Model Training Script:**
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit Web Application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

## **Usage**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and removing duplicates.
2. **Model Training**: The Random Forest model is trained and saved to the `models` directory.
3. **Streamlit Application**: Users can input data through the Streamlit web app and receive predictions on financial inclusion.

## **Deployment**
The app can be deployed on [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/). Once deployed, users can access the app online, allowing for easy interaction and demonstration of the predictive capabilities.
